# MiSACO-and-EOPCCV
The full name of MiSACO is "Multisurrogate-Assisted Ant Colony Optimization". It is designed for expensive optimization problems with continuous and categorical variables.

EOPCCV contains 30 synthetic mixed-variable benchmark problems: EOPCCV-F1~EOPCCV-F30. These benchmarks are grouped into three categories, each comprising 10 decision variables:
1) Type 1 (EOPCCV-F1~EOPCCV-F10): 8 continuous + 2 categorical variables
2) Type 2 (EOPCCV-F11~EOPCCV-F20): 5 continuous + 5 categorical variables
3) Type 3 (EOPCCV-F21~EOPCCV-F30): 2 continuous + 8 categorical variables

MiSACO and EOPCCV are implemented in Matlab based on PlatEMO 4.13 (https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO).
